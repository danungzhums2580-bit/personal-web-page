            <li style="font-weight: bold;">The day of the jakal</li>
            <p>
                The narrative showcases the cold professionalism of an anonymous assassin, <br>
                known only as the "Jackal," as he plots to kill French President Charles de Gaulle, <br>
                while a dogged and methodical detective races against time to stop him.

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Game of Thrones</li>
            <p>
                A complex fantasy drama about a brutal, multi-generational struggle for the Iron Throne <br>
                in the fictional land of Westeros. The core conflict involves several powerful noble families <br>
                vying for control, a fight complicated by shifting alliances, betrayals, and a looming, ancient <br>
                threat of ice zombies called White Walkers descending from the North. It is known for its dark, realistic <br>
                take on medieval-style politics, focusing on political intrigue, power, and the human cost of war, rather <br>
                than simply magic.

            <p>
                Action-packed crime drama that chronicles the remarkable and often brutal transformation of Teresa Mendoza <br>
                from a poor, innocent woman into a cunning, powerful drug cartel leader. It's a gripping story of survival, <br>
                ambition, and the emotional cost of power.
